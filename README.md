We built a Movie Tracker App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to manage movie watchlists. Users can add movies, mark them as watched or not watched, add favorite scenes, edit or delete entries, and see lists update dynamically. The app is fully responsive and focuses on DOM manipulation and UI interactions.
